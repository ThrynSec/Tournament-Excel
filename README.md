# Tournament Excel
This incredibly well named project is a macro-based Excel file made to manage tournaments in a user friendly way.

Everyone uses Excel already, let's just automate that ...

## How to use :
- Change the Webhook URL in the code, in the Public Const in beggining of the VB Code
- Put a SIMPLE list of username starting on A1 and going downward
- Enjoy the magic

## Features :
- Automatically randomize player pool
- Custom number of player per lobby
- Automatically and randomly assign players to a lobby
- Basic ELO calculation (based on 12 players because this is made for Sonic Racing Crossworlds)
- Free communication through a Discord Webhook
- Can automatically communicate Lobbies to Discord through Webhook (Text)

## Potential Roadmap :
- BUGFIX : Being able to enter how many players per lobby will advance to next round 
- Better Elo calculation
- Screenshot of brackets to Discord
- Double Elimination & Swiss format
